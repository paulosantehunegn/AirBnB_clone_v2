Requirements

Python Scripts

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3

A README.md file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)

Your Fabric file must work with Fabric 3 version 1.14.post1 (installation instruction below)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
